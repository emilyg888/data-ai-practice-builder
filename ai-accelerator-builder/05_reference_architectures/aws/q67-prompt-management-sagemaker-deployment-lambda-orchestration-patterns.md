# 67: Agent Orchestration Patterns

## Scenario

A product team is building an internal chat assistant for customer support agents by using Amazon Bedrock. After launch, the team needs a user-centered way to continuously improve response quality by collecting per-response ratings and optional written feedback, and to later analyze feedback by model and prompt version. The team wants a solution that is serverless and requires the LEAST operational overhead. Which solution will meet these requirements?

## Common implementation patterns

- Add a “Rate this answer” feature in the web UI that calls an Amazon API Gateway REST endpoint. Use an AWS Lambda function to validate the request and store the rating, free-text feedback, and metadata (model ID and prompt version) in an Amazon DynamoDB table...

## Architecture guidance

- A user-centered evaluation mechanism requires collecting explicit feedback from the people using the application (for example, thumbs up/down, star ratings, and optional comments or corrections) and persisting that...
- A serverless feedback endpoint implemented with Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda can receive feedback events from the application UI and perform basic validation and enrichment (such as attaching the model ID and...
- Storing these records in Amazon DynamoDB keeps the solution fully managed and scalable with minimal operational burden, while enabling later analysis and continuous improvement cycles based on real user experience.

## AWS documentation validation

- Validated: Bedrock Agents support action groups for tool/API fulfillment, and AWS documents supervisor/collaborator multi-agent patterns for complex task decomposition.
- Validated: Bedrock Prompt management supports reusable prompts, variables, variants, versioning, testing, and integration into model invocation or flows.
- Validated: Lambda is appropriate for short serverless integration logic; Step Functions is the AWS-documented orchestration option for multi-step workflows across Lambda and other AWS services.
- Validated: SageMaker real-time endpoints are suited to low-latency custom model inference, batch transform is suited to offline or large-batch inference, and data capture supports model monitoring workflows.
- Validated: Amazon Bedrock evaluations support model, Knowledge Base, and RAG-source evaluation, including LLM-as-judge metrics such as correctness, completeness, faithfulness, helpfulness, relevance, and instruction following.

## AWS-supported alternative patterns

- For complex multi-domain workflows, consider Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration with a supervisor agent and specialized collaborator agents instead of a single broad agent.
- For enterprise tool integration or custom agent frameworks, consider Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime and AgentCore Gateway with MCP-compatible tools.
- For model cost and quality tradeoffs across similar models, evaluate Bedrock intelligent prompt routing rather than maintaining only custom routing logic.
- For release control, store prompt versions and compare prompt variants before promotion instead of relying on ad hoc prompt text in application code.
- Use Step Functions when the workflow needs visible state, retries, error handling, human approval, or multi-service coordination; keep direct Lambda for simple request/response or event handlers.
- Use EventBridge for event-driven decoupling and routing when multiple downstream consumers or asynchronous integration patterns are required.
- Use Bedrock managed foundation models when custom model hosting is not required; use SageMaker endpoints when the workload requires custom containers, custom model artifacts, or lower-level hosting control.
- For offline scoring or scheduled inference, prefer SageMaker Batch Transform over a persistent endpoint.
- Use Bedrock RAG evaluations when retrieval and generated-answer quality need to be assessed together; use model evaluation jobs when comparing model or prompt behavior independent of retrieval.
- For every production implementation, verify current Region/model support, IAM permissions, service quotas, logging retention, encryption, and data-residency requirements in the target AWS account.
