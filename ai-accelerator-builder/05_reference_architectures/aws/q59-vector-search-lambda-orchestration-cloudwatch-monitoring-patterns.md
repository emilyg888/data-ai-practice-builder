# 59: Throughput Patterns

## Scenario

A product support team has built a public FAQ assistant that uses Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda to invoke an Amazon Bedrock text model. The assistant does not use user-specific context, and the team has configured the model with deterministic settings so the same question produces the same answer. Metrics show that a large percentage of requests are repeated verbatim across users, and the team wants to reduce Amazon Bedrock invocation costs and improve global response latency. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

## Common implementation patterns

- Implement semantic caching by storing embeddings of prompts and corresponding responses in Amazon MemoryDB. For each new prompt, generate an embedding and perform nearest-neighbor lookup. If the similarity score exceeds a threshold, return the cached response...

## Architecture guidance

- Because many requests are exact repeats and the responses are deterministic, the best optimization is to avoid invoking the FM when a previous identical response already exists.
- Edge caching with CloudFront accomplishes this by serving cached responses from edge locations, improving latency for global users while reducing total Bedrock invocations.
- A deterministic request fingerprint provides a stable cache key and helps ensure cache correctness when prompts or model parameters change.

## AWS documentation validation

- Validated: Bedrock Agents support action groups for tool/API fulfillment, and AWS documents supervisor/collaborator multi-agent patterns for complex task decomposition.
- Validated: Bedrock Prompt management supports reusable prompts, variables, variants, versioning, testing, and integration into model invocation or flows.
- Validated: Lambda is appropriate for short serverless integration logic; Step Functions is the AWS-documented orchestration option for multi-step workflows across Lambda and other AWS services.
- Validated: Amazon Bedrock evaluations support model, Knowledge Base, and RAG-source evaluation, including LLM-as-judge metrics such as correctness, completeness, faithfulness, helpfulness, relevance, and instruction following.
- Validated: Bedrock supports model invocation logging to CloudWatch Logs or S3 for runtime request/response metadata, and CloudTrail records Bedrock API activity for audit trails.

## AWS-supported alternative patterns

- For complex multi-domain workflows, consider Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration with a supervisor agent and specialized collaborator agents instead of a single broad agent.
- For enterprise tool integration or custom agent frameworks, consider Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime and AgentCore Gateway with MCP-compatible tools.
- For model cost and quality tradeoffs across similar models, evaluate Bedrock intelligent prompt routing rather than maintaining only custom routing logic.
- For release control, store prompt versions and compare prompt variants before promotion instead of relying on ad hoc prompt text in application code.
- Use Step Functions when the workflow needs visible state, retries, error handling, human approval, or multi-service coordination; keep direct Lambda for simple request/response or event handlers.
- Use EventBridge for event-driven decoupling and routing when multiple downstream consumers or asynchronous integration patterns are required.
- Use Bedrock RAG evaluations when retrieval and generated-answer quality need to be assessed together; use model evaluation jobs when comparing model or prompt behavior independent of retrieval.
- Use CloudTrail for control-plane and API activity auditability; use model invocation logging when teams need request/response payload metadata for operational review, subject to privacy and retention controls.
- For every production implementation, verify current Region/model support, IAM permissions, service quotas, logging retention, encryption, and data-residency requirements in the target AWS account.
