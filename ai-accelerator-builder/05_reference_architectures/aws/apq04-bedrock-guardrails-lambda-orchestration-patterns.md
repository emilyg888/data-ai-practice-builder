# 4: Guardrails Patterns

## Scenario

A GenAI developer must create dynamic content filtering for a customer service chat-based AI assistant. Multiple departments in a company use the assistant. The assistant is deployed on an Amazon Nova Pro model. AWS Lambda functions handle the chat logic. The company has the following requirements: Stricter content policies must be enforced during business hours. Each department must have department-specific filtering rules. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails must be used for content filtering. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

## Common implementation patterns

- Use the answer key and visible explanation text as the basis for the endorsed architecture pattern when the source export does not preserve the full correct-option body.

## Architecture guidance

- Guardrails can provide content filtering at the model invocation level.
- Guardrails has built-in capabilities to manage different filtering contexts.
- You can create a single guardrail with maximum restrictions.

## AWS documentation validation

- Validated: Bedrock Guardrails support content filters, denied topics, sensitive-information handling, contextual grounding checks, and automated reasoning checks for policy validation.
- Validated: Bedrock Prompt management supports reusable prompts, variables, variants, versioning, testing, and integration into model invocation or flows.
- Validated: Lambda is appropriate for short serverless integration logic; Step Functions is the AWS-documented orchestration option for multi-step workflows across Lambda and other AWS services.
- Validated: Bedrock supports model invocation logging to CloudWatch Logs or S3 for runtime request/response metadata, and CloudTrail records Bedrock API activity for audit trails.

## AWS-supported alternative patterns

- For pre-retrieval or post-generation checks outside model invocation, use the standalone ApplyGuardrail API so user input or generated output can be assessed independently.
- For policy-heavy workflows, consider Automated Reasoning checks in Guardrails to validate outputs against formalized natural-language policies; account for detect-mode behavior and added latency.
- For model cost and quality tradeoffs across similar models, evaluate Bedrock intelligent prompt routing rather than maintaining only custom routing logic.
- For release control, store prompt versions and compare prompt variants before promotion instead of relying on ad hoc prompt text in application code.
- Use Step Functions when the workflow needs visible state, retries, error handling, human approval, or multi-service coordination; keep direct Lambda for simple request/response or event handlers.
- Use EventBridge for event-driven decoupling and routing when multiple downstream consumers or asynchronous integration patterns are required.
- Use CloudTrail for control-plane and API activity auditability; use model invocation logging when teams need request/response payload metadata for operational review, subject to privacy and retention controls.
- For every production implementation, verify current Region/model support, IAM permissions, service quotas, logging retention, encryption, and data-residency requirements in the target AWS account.

## Source Notes

- The source export is partial for this question, so the endorsed pattern is inferred from the preserved prompt and answer key.
